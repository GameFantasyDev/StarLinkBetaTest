In order to make all of players can understand how to play our games as soon as possible. So that we have made this tutorial for newcomers to get started with our game.

# Download iopay

LinkStar game is running on iotex public chain, so in order to run the game you need to download a wallet to store your assets and interact with the game contract, the download link is: [iopay Wallet](https://iopay-wallet.iotex.io/)

In the website you can choose the environment that suits you, both mobile wallet and desktop wallet can be used to play the game. However, the game does not support web3 wallets for the time being, but it will support popular wallets like metamask in the future.

Once the wallet is ready, next step is to create and unlock the wallet.

Then, after officially launched, you can find the game's icon link in the discovery page and click on it to play the game:

![wallet4](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/wallet4.png)

![wallet5](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/wallet5.png)

There are several known issues that may prevent the game from being played that require special attention.

<font color=#FFC0CB size=3>Desktop Wallet:</font>

- Please turn off the global mode of VPN to prevent the inability to connect to the wallet.
- If you have installed adblock in your browser before , please disable adblock temporarily to avoid the problem of not being able to connect to the server.

<font color=#FFC0CB size=3>Mobile Wallet IOS Version:</font>

- The newly downloaded wallet may not find the page at first. Because of the Apple App Store Review, you need to manually activate the discovery page for iopay by yourself: you can go to safari and type in https://iotexdefi.com (you may need to use VPN). Scroll down and click on "Enable Discover Tab". Log in to ioPay and add it!

# Use Mimo v2 to exchange GFT

The common currency used in the game is GFT, and all economic transactions between players and contracts cannot be made without GFT. So in order to play the game smoothly, you need to use IOTX on Mimo to swap GFT.Firstly,you need to open Mimo on the discovery page of the wallet, if you didn't find it in the list, please click "More" to find mimo in the list.

![wallet6](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/wallet6.png)

Then, Click the Connect in the upper right corner in that page by default to connect your wallet, select the web3 wallet in the pop-up dialog, then click a button in the iopay pop-up box to confirm:

![mimo1](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/mimo1.png)

![mimo2](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/mimo2.png)

![mimo3](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/mimo3.png)

After the wallet is logged in, IOTX will be selected by default as your first choice, you can select the button below to select the token. After you find GFT in the list, the interface will return to the trading interface. Enter the number of IOTX you want to swap in the IOTX input box , and it will show you the swap ratio and the number of GFT you can swap now.

![mimo4](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/mimo4.png)

![mimo5](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/mimo5.png)

![mimo6](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/mimo6.png)

Then we click "Swap "to redeem and an information screen will pop up to show the IOTX/GFT rate. After confirming the information,you can click"the "Confirm" below to confirm information. Click OK in the wallet dialog box that pops up. After waiting for a few seconds, you will see a message at the top of the screen that the swap is complete.

![mimo10](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/mimo10.png)

< color=#FFC0CB size=3>After the above steps have been completed, all preparations for the game are done. Let's click on the link and start the game! </>font

# Store interface

Please attention, when we entrance the game at the first time,it will take 10-20 seconds to the game interface. If you have been waiting for here more than 25 seconds, you can have a try to restart the game. If it doesn't work, please try to connect VPN again. If all goes well, you will see the auction page in the "Market" interface. Or you can access auction page via the third button "Market" out of the four buttons below.

![game1](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/game1.png)

![game2](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/game2.png)

This screen is probably the one that players will spend the most time on, so let's break it down into several sections.

## Official Auction

This is a default interface that opens when you enter the game at the first time, there are 20 NFT cards waiting to be adopted. The NFT cards in this page are divided into 4 pages, There are six starmons on each page, except for two on the last page. You can turn the page up and down at the bottom of the page, or click the middle page part to entrance that page you want.

![game3](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/game3.png)

We focus on a particular NFT, which contains detailed information on the auction and quality of this NFT. Such as the following information:

![game4](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/game4.png)

<font color=#FFC0CB size=3>There are 5 quality levels in the game, from low to high, N, R, SR, SSR, UR. The higher quality, the higher mining ability and it means the better performance in the in-game arena. High rarity NFTs are well worth having and will make it easier for you to navigate the world of LinkStar and reap greater benefits as well. </font>

The overall rating depends on the overall quality of the eight parts of the NFT. Underneath the NFT skin there are 8 crystal spheres, which correspond to the quality of each of the 8 different parts of the NFT. The part quality page, like the overall quality, has 5 levels, which correspond to the colours of each of the 8 crystal spheres. The colour correspondence of the crystal spheres is as follows.

- Gray (N)
- Blue (R)
- Purple (SR)
- Orange (SSR)
- Color (UR)

The color of the 8 crystal balls will ultimately determine the overall quality of the NFT, which is the background of the skin. Reaching a certain score the background of the NFT will be changed and make it will look more beautiful. We will mention these 8 crystal balls again when compositing. Please remember their meaning.

If you want to see the style and quality of a specific part, you can tap on the exclamation point in the upper right corner of the NFT, which will display a hover window with the information you want. The NFT number is below the crystal, which is unique number to the game, Later, you can get the details for how to view the properties of an NFT through the ID.

Auction information are below the NFT . In total, there are 3 pieces.

- The top level is the current auction price of the NFT, with a default starting price of 0.01 GFT (this can be adjusted via DAO later ). When someone has shot the NFT, the price will change, the minimum raise is 0.01GFT. but if there are more people competing, it is recommended that you bid a more competitive price, otherwise your bid is exceeded, although the GFT will be returned to you. The GAS you consume will not be refunded, because it was a fees charged by the iotex blockchain.
- The address shown below the price is the address of the highest bidder. If it doesn't match your address, it meas you didn't participate or participated but your bid was overtaken by someone else. At this point, you can re-bid to compete for ownership. (This information will not displayed when an NFT has no bids, like the third one from left to right in the picture above)
- The last information below the owner is the current time left in the auction. This is calculated by the number of blocks. (A block is 5 seconds.) If a bid is successful, the time will be remade into 50 blocks.(that is 250 seconds) If no one continues to bid at the end of the countdown, the NFT will go through all the processes of the highest bidder. The NFT can be found and claimed in the My Transaction tab.

If you are interested in this NFT, you can click the bid button at the bottom right. This will open the NFT details screen as follows.

![game5](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/game5.png)

As I said earlier, all the details of this NFT are recorded here, (other content will be added later, such as the NFT's skills) and its current auction price. Make sure that there is no problem then click the bid. there will pop up the wallet confirmation box in the screen, after click the confirm button, the transaction will be sended .for save your time of buying, we removed the mandatory waiting and refreshing. After the contract is executed, you need to switch the tab to refresh.

## Free Market

Switch to the first tab on the left, this is a Free Market.All the NFTs that players want to sell and the bids of NFTs will be showed in the list on the Market. If you are interested in one of them, you can click on the Buy button, which will bring up a detailed screen just like the auction interface. After you continue the next step that click to buy, a wallet confirmation window will pop up. If you didn't have enough money, the contract will be fail and the gas fee will not be refunded, as mentioned above. As with the official auction, you can click on the bottom to skip to other pages.

![game6](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/game6.png)

## My Transaction

Switch to the last tab on the right and here is 'My Transaction'. Details of your NFT holdings are shown here. This includes those you normally own, those you are selling, and those you have successfully auctioned for collection. The green Collect All button allows you to collect all pending NFTs with one click, The purple price indicates that the NFT is for sale, click on GetBack to take the NFT you are selling off the shelf. Those with a Sell button represent NFTs you own, which are available for sale. Click on the Sell button to enter your desired price in the pop-up details screen, then do the same as above. All the steps you finished, your NFT will be selling in the Market.

![game7](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/game7.png)

# Mining interface

## NFT mining

YOU can skip to StarMine by clicking the last button 'StarMine' at the bottom of the main screen. Here we can send NFTs into the mine to mine for us. Your amount depends on the sum of the mining power of all the NFTs you send. There is no limit to the number of NFTs you can send, but please try to send NFTs of high quality, because their mining power will be stronger than others. The higher the quality, the more obvious this advantage will be.

![game8](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/game8.png)

We can select the NFT which we want to dispatch, and then it will show up a green tick above it. Then click the dispatch button below and after the wallet authorization has been approved, the NFT will be working in the StarMine.

If the manual refresh is successful, the dispatched NFT will be covered with a grey mask. A dispatched text message will be displayed. The top mining power and acquired values will also start to update at the same time. If you select the dispatched NFT at this point, the text below will change to recall. A recall can be made to an NFT that has already been dispatched. Either dispatching or recalling will clear the number of GFTs already earned by 0 and collect them directly to your wallet. You can also collect the accumulated GFTs manually by clicking on the Collect button.

## Liquidity Mining

There is a liquidity mine above the mining power, taping on it to open the liquidity mining screen. Here you can mine GFS by pledging the LP of GFT-IOTX on Mimo v2.

<font color=#FFC0CB size=3>About GFS: GFS is a community pass for GameFantasy with a total of 30million. It is completely 100% fair, no team share, no ecological share. More in-game access will be opened in the future. It can be used for in-game GFS exclusive bonus pool mining, various syrup pool mining expected to be open in the future, and StarLink DAO rights. More pass economies will be announced when the game official launch. </font>

![game9](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/game9.png)

The first time to turn on the liquidity mining, you need to authorize the liquidity mining contract, After clicking on the authorise button and confirming it in your wallet, wait about 10 seconds for the liquidity mining switch to turn on.
At this point the Authorize button will disappear and two additional buttons will appear: Add and Remove.
Add is to pledge LP to the contract to obtain GFS, Remove is to unpledge LP that have already been pledged.

![game10](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/game10.png)

We click the Add button, which will open the Pledge screen. The screen will shows the number of LP you currently have for liquidity on Mimo v2 (or the number of LP you have pledged if you click the remove button). Clicking the Max button will automatically fill the maximum amount you have. Clicking Confirm and confirming the wallet action will close the screen and refresh the liquidity mining screen, where you will see the LP you have pledged, and the number of GFS acquisitions will start to rise in the same time.

![game11](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/game11.png)

![game12](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/game12.png)

You can click the receive button at any time to collect the GFS you have acquired.

## How to provide liquidity on Mimo to participate in liquidity mining

In order to participate in liquidity mining, we must first open Mimo, just as described above. Open Mimo and log in, but unlike above, we select Liquidity, then click on the Add Liquidity button and IOTX will be automatically selected at the top, select IOTX at the bottom just as you did for the exchange. After confirming your wallet, wait for a while and you will see the liquidity you have added.

# Synthesis Interface

You can use the second button(Polymerization) below to skip to the NFT synthesis interface. This is the only way to obtain high quality NFTs in the game. Of course, synthesis is not without risk, and your synthesis may yield an undesirable result. Our advice is as follows:

- Two NFT of eight crystal ball you want to inherit that part of the color is preferably the same, or not too big difference. (For example, if you want to keep the SSR of the head, then you should prepare the two NFT head preferably both SSR)
- Even if you do this, you may not always get the best results, but it's already much better than messing around.
- Synthesis is risky, if you think you can not afford the risk then you can hang the cards on the free market. This way you can earn income and those willing to take on the challenge have a better chance of getting their ideal NFT.
- The mining power and future combat skills of a high quality NFT will be much better, so try to get a high quality NFT if possible, it will have a lot of positive effects on the journey afterwards.
- Synthesis is a long and hard road, do not synthesize impulsively. Failure not to give up, one day you will get your ideal partner.

If you are familiar with all of the above, you can choose two NFTs to synthesize. The selected NFT will be indicated by a green check mark on the top of the NFT and placed on the top two empty spaces. Once both NFTs are placed, you can click the synthesis button to synthesize them. After waiting for the blockchain to finish executing, a synthesis animation will be played and your synthesis result will be displayed.

![game15](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/game15.png)

<font color=#FFC0CB size=3>Good luck always! </font>

# My Starmon interface

Click on the first of the four buttons below My Starmon to skip to the My Starmon screen. Note that if your NFTs are being sold in the free market or mined, they will not be shown here, so go to the corresponding screen. A new search function has been added to the top left corner. Enter the ID of the NFT you want to see in the input box to display the details of that NFT.

![game16](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/game16.png)

The top left is your login address, in the auction interface to see if it is your best bid must be carefully compared.

![game17](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/game17.png)

The two flags in the middle above the interface can switch the language display of most of the game in addition to the pictures, to help people who are not familiar with English understand the game. (Pictures will be added later and replaced together)

![game18](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/game18.png)

The top right of the interface shows the number of GFT and IOTX you currently have. (Compared to the internal alpha test, the display of IOTX has been added, so that you can easily know how much iotex you have left)

![game19](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/game19.png)

<font color=#FFC0CB size=13>Finally, we hope everyone enjoys LinkStar! </font>
