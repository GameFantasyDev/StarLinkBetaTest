# StarLink public test game method

**This public test is a censored test. All cards won by players will be discarded when they are officially launched. Tokens obtained during the game test are the main net's official GFT. We did a lot of optimization in this test compared to the last one. The gas fee used in the game was also significantly reduced by more than 50% as compared to the previous one.**

**The network for this test is the iotex main network, and the general license used in the game is the main network GFT, of which the liquidity mining is the LP of IOTX-GFT, and the output is DAO token GFS.**

**About GFS: GFS is a community token for GameFantasy totaling 30M. Full 100% fair distribution, no team share, no ecological share. Later will open up more in-game access. Can be used for in-game GFS-exclusive bonus pool mining, various syrup pool mining that are expected to open in the future and StarLink's DAO rights. More pass card economy will be announced after the game goes online.**

**About GFT：GFT is the currency pass for use in the StarLink game with a hard top 30M. (This cap is not subject to change and the contract removes the changed method) All trading activities within StarLink are conducted using GFT, including arena features expected to be developed later, other social events, and so on. The vast majority of GFT will be produced in the form of mining, in-game system income pass will be added to the bonus pool for GFS holders to share.**

Players taking part in game testing can download iopay mobile wallets or desktop wallets. Then play with a wallet that is not as important to you as a wallet.

Please turn off the global mode of vpn during the game to avoid the problem of not connecting to the wallet. If your brow has adblock installed, please temporarily close adblock to avoid that problem of not connecte to the server.

During the test, it is recommended to use the desktop version of iopay as much as possible, so that the developer tool query log can be opened in the browser, which makes it easier for us to locate the problem.

Game loainding interface after waiting for about 5-10 seconds (according to the network situation may be extended, please wait patiently) will pop up the signature of the wallet, click ok to enter the game.

If you want to perform liquidity mining GFS, then you need to turn on mimov2 to provide liquidity to the IOTX-GFT trading pair and pledge within the game to obtain GFS.

## How to provide liquidity to GFT on mimo v2?

Open the https://mimo.exchange/, please.

Then you can see the lp token provided by you in the in-game liquidity mining interface. The prize for pledged mining will be GFS.

## Game play

There are four buttons at the bottom of the main game interface:

- Nft display interface
- Nft synthesis interface
- Nft transaction auction interface
- Nft mining interface

## Nft display interface

![image](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/main.png)

Click the enter first button to enter the nft display interface, which is also the default game initialization interface. Maybe at first everyone didn't have a new card. Don't worry, you can get your card in the trade auction interface. If you get your card, you can see your card information here. The exclamation mark in the upper right corner can be used to view the card's detailed quality and information. If your card's total body part score reaches one, the card's background will change.

The upper and middle of the game interface can switch the language displayed in the game. The search function at the bottom of the diagonal can let you easily view the card attributes corresponding to a certain id at present. There are 8 colored crystal balls in the middle of the lower part of each card, and each crystal ball corresponds to the quality of a part of the card. This way you can easily know the approximate quality information of this card and find the appropriate card when you combine it.

## Nft synthesis interface

![image](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/mix.png)

The nft Synthesis interface allows the synthesis of two nft cards. This gives the chance to get a higher quality card, and all attrib-utes will be inherited and evolved from the parent card. The rarity of all body parts is not lower than that of both parents. So the synthesis time everybody must grasp this most basic principle. If you want to keep a rarity somewhere on your card, then you must have at least both parents reach that rarity. (such as R and R synthesis is not even lower than the quality of r) selected after the good synthesis of card, click on the synthesis call contract, wait-ing for about 10 seconds contract will be executed will play a composite animation, generate a new card.

## Nft transaction auction interface

Nft trading auction interface we are divided into three parts:

### Nft trading interface

![image](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/freedom.png)

Entering the market is the default open nft free trade interface. Here you can see the cards that players hang out and sell in the game. There will be other players' selling prices in the red box above. Click Buy to pop up the cat details interface, where you can view the details of selling cats. Wait approximately 10 sec-onds after clicking Confirm to invoke the contract here and if your GFT balance is sufficient, purchase this card into your warehouse. A page shows 10 items, the more can be in the bottom red box to page, click on the middle page number can pop up jump page, jump to any one page number. The screening function of cards that are convenient for players to browse will be added later. Please be patient.

#### Nft auction interface:

![image](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/bid.png)

This is the official vertical screen. There will always be 20 cards waiting to be adopted. As long as any player bids on one of them, the countdown will begin. After a certain number of blocks (a block is about 5 seconds) if someone continues to bid, the count-down to this card increases by a certain number of blocks. Until no one bids, the card goes through the individual's process. You can receive this card in the third interface. Note that the refresh section is currently under optimization and the list refresh rate is not fast. Please be patient.

#### My card interface:

![image](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/myshop.png)

This interface lists all the cards you have, including those you are selling and can receive. You can also put your cards on the mar-ket for sale in this interface. Other players will be able to look up your order information on the first screen. If there is a deal, 0.3% (adjusted later by DAO) will be deducted from the amount you can get as a handling charge. This fee will be deposited into the game's dividend pool. For long-term contributions to the game players to share. As shown in the above figure, receive indicates the card you bid for from the system auction, and getback indi-cates that you can dismount a card you have mounted. Sale means you can put your card on the shelf for sale. There is no time limit for sales.

## Nft mining interface:

![image](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/mining.png)

Nft cards have an attribute called Digging Power, which deter-mines the weight of the ore that your card sends out. The ore pool will be allocated GFTs based on the total ore digging force of all cards. Once you have dispatched the nft card to dig for miner-als, the card will be removed from your warehouse. But you can still see it at the mine and recall it. This nft card will temporarily not belong to you until you recall it to its place. The gray card with dispatching at the bottom of the picture is the card you have sent to dig.

![image](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/lpmining.png)

The nft Digging Interface has an lp Digging where you can use gft and iotx pair to provide liquidity on Mimo v2 to obtain an lp token. Here, the pledge of lp token can be used to participate in Liquidity mining. The reward for Liquidity mining will be the DAO governance token GFS of the game. Holding GFS is like holding shares in linkstar, where you will be able to share the rewards in the bonus pool. GFS will later also open up other ways to get to play games within the game. GFS will be distributed fairly and on-ly by way of contribution to the game, and GFS's pass-through economy will be released when the game goes live. The address of the test network GFS is io1e29sfsedd0fvs4czpcws5w8un60w2n6qfpum4t. You can view the test network GFS by adding a custom xrc20 to enter the address in the test network status. At the beginning of the document there is an in-troduction to how lp liquidity provision is made.
