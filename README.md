We suggest you participating in the game test by using the desk-top version of iopay, so that you can open the developer tool que-ry log in the browser, and then we can find the problem easily.

https://faucet.iotex.io/
You can apply for 1000 iotx test coins per person at a time. The gas used in the game is sufficient.

There are four buttons at the bottom of the main game interface:

- Nft display interface
- Nft synthesis interface
- Nft transaction auction interface
- Nft mining interface

## Nft display interface

Click the enter first button to enter the nft display interface, which is the default game initialization interface. Maybe everyone did-n't have a new cat at first. Don't worry, you can get your cat in the trade auction interface. If you get a cat that belongs to you, you can see information about your cat here. The exclamation mark in the upper right corner can be used to view the detailed quality and information of the cat. The background of the cat card will be changed according to the total score of body parts of the cat .

## Nft synthesis interface

The nft Synthesis interface allows the synthesis of two nft cards. This gives the chance to get a higher quality card, and all attrib-utes will be inherited and evolved from the parent card. The rarity of all body parts is not lower than that of both parents. So the synthesis time everybody must grasp this most basic principle. If you want to keep a rarity somewhere on your card, then you must have at least both parents reach that rarity. (such as R and R synthesis is not even lower than the quality of r) selected after the good synthesis of card, click on the synthesis call contract, wait-ing for about 10 seconds contract will be executed will play a composite animation, generate a new card.

## Nft transaction auction interface

Nft trading auction interface we are divided into three parts:

### Nft trading interface

![image](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/freedom.png)

Entering the market is the default open nft free trade interface. Here you can see the cards that players hang out and sell in the game. There will be other players' selling prices in the red box above. Click Buy to pop up the cat details interface, where you can view the details of selling cats. Wait approximately 10 sec-onds after clicking Confirm to invoke the contract here and if your GFT balance is sufficient, purchase this card into your warehouse. A page shows 10 items, the more can be in the bottom red box to page, click on the middle page number can pop up jump page, jump to any one page number. The screening function of cards that are convenient for players to browse will be added later. Please be patient.

#### Nft auction interface:

![image](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/bid.png)

This is the official vertical screen. There will always be 20 cards waiting to be adopted. As long as any player bids on one of them, the countdown will begin. After a certain number of blocks (a block is about 5 seconds) if someone continues to bid, the count-down to this card increases by a certain number of blocks. Until no one bids, the card goes through the individual's process. You can receive this card in the third interface. Note that the refresh section is currently under optimization and the list refresh rate is not fast. Please be patient.

#### My card interface:

![image](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/myshop.png)

This interface lists all the cards you have, including those you are selling and can receive. You can also put your cards on the mar-ket for sale in this interface. Other players will be able to look up your order information on the first screen. If there is a deal, 0.3% (adjusted later by DAO) will be deducted from the amount you can get as a handling charge. This fee will be deposited into the game's dividend pool. For long-term contributions to the game players to share. As shown in the above figure, receive indicates the card you bid for from the system auction, and getback indi-cates that you can dismount a card you have mounted. Sale means you can put your card on the shelf for sale. There is no time limit for sales.

## Nft mining interface:

![image](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/mining.png)

Nft cards have an attribute called Digging Power, which deter-mines the weight of the ore that your card sends out. The ore pool will be allocated GFTs based on the total ore digging force of all cards. Once you have dispatched the nft card to dig for miner-als, the card will be removed from your warehouse. But you can still see it at the mine and recall it. This nft card will temporarily not belong to you until you recall it to its place. The gray card with dispatching at the bottom of the picture is the card you have sent to dig.

![image](https://github.com/GameFantasyDev/StarLinkBetaTest/blob/main/IMG/lpmining.png)

The nft Digging Interface has an lp Digging where you can use a tested gft and iotx pair to provide liquidity on MITV2 to obtain an lp token. Here, the pledge of lp token can be used to participate in mobile mining. The reward for mobile mining will be the DAO governance token GFS of the game. Holding GFS is like holding shares in linkstar, where you will be able to share the rewards in the bonus pool. GFS will later also open up other ways to get to play games within the game. GFS will be distributed fairly and on-ly by way of contribution to the game, and GFS's pass-through economy will be released when the game goes live. The address of the test network GFS is io1z2l3ncsfp4ja7fttm74kycrjrtsrexarz3t0n2. You can view the test network GFS by adding a custom xrc20 to enter the address in the test network status. At the beginning of the document there is an in-troduction to how lp liquidity provision is made.
