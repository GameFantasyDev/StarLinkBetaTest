Explanation for migrating Mimo v1 mobility to v2
In order to participate in the liquidity mining of linkstar, a new game of GameFantasy, we need to migrate the liquidity to v2. The version used in the game is mimo v2. here's how it works:

First turn on mimo on iopay. Then we're going to first remove the liquidity of the GFT on v1. Click the button in the red box to go to v1.

The pop-up interface continues to confrim ok. Waiting for about ten seconds after the confirmation box pops up in iopay can release the liquidity of v1. You'll also have some more IOTX and GFT in your wallet.

Then we can quickly switch mimo off and back on to v2. This time we hit v2 at the top right.

Here we select max next to GFTs, and the current maximum number of GFTs will be automatically filled in. Of course you can manually enter the number you want by yourself, please make sure there is enough IOTX in your wallet as a liquidity pair.

Then we select supply in the figure below, and an information box pops up. After confirming that there is no problem, click confirm, and confirm after iopay popup window, liquidity can be provided on v2.

This completes the entire mobility shift from mimo v1 to mimo v2. After linkstar is officially launched, you can see the liquidity you provide in the game and participate in liquidity mining to obtain GFS tokens.
